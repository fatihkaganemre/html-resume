            <h3>Karate</h3>

            <p>
                I started Karate when I was child. Since then it was part of my life. 
                I feel different when I step on tatami. Karate is like water to me. I should admit,
                I dont always love it but I can`t live without. I have black belt first dan (Shodan) 
                I am a karate coach in Kuzi Sport. I teach both kata and kumite. <br>

            <p>
                I play baglama, it is a traditional instrument. 
                I sometimes lose myself whlie playing it.
                I like singing too. I actually sing a lot :)
